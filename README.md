## Dev Test Project

This project has been created to estimate a developers understanding of some everyday coding concepts. This is not a test of what you have memorised, or 
the latest and greatest algorithm challenges from Leetcode. Instead it is designed for us to see how you might work and the steps you take to solve everyday
problems.

I am intentionally vague here and some things might slip you up. Feel free to ask questions.

You will not be judged on styling or even the final visible product. We are looking at your process, how you navigate code and the documentation and time to iterate.

## Assumptions & Definitions

All tasks should follow industry standards for security, REST, SEO, mobile first, accessibility.

We use the following and if you are interviewing for this role we assume you have experience in at least some of these technologies. 
- Next.js 14 (App router)
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase
- AWS
- SST

We also use a few other technologies and languages for different services.

## Front End

You have just joined the Pokemon web team, here is your first ticket!!

A private security analyst the company has used in the past has submitted a bug bounty, they have pointed out we are leaking super secret company data to users. Pokemon has not paid
the $10,000,0000,000 bounty the analyst is asking but the team would like an engineer to look into the leak as he has been a trusted source in the past. 

You also notice when you get everything running there is other issues. There isn't even anything displayed on the page!!

Here are the docs to your super secret API https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2

While the main task is securing the data. you should also correct any mistakes you find along the way.

It would also be nice if we could add some sort options maybe people want the pokemon sorted by there number or in alphabetical order

Finally you also realise there is no page for each specific pokemon. You should create this page and display some basic data about each pokemon
